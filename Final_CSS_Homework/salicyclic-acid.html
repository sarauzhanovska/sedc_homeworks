                <h3>Anti Acne Serum</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Our clinically formulated Anti Acne Serum has 2% Salicylic Acid to clear and prevent breakouts. Fast absorbing, it leaves skin clear, smooth and balanced. In just 24 hours, you'll see a significant improvement in blackheads & pimples. You'll also see visibly smaller pores, even skin texture/tone and skin microbiome will be balanced.

                    Why 2% Salicylic Acid: Salicylic Acid is a BHA which works by dissolving dead skin cells and sebum from deep within, giving you fresh skin. We've made this formula with the most potent percentage of Salicylic Acid, giving you faster and safe results.
                    
                    Helps prevent acne: The skin cells in the lining of people with acne tend to multiply quickly, and stick to one another. 2% Salicylic Acid serum works by dissolving the bond that holds the sticky cells together in the clogged pores. 
                    
                    Minimizes pore appearance: The anti-inflammatory properties of our Anti Acne Serum for acne prone skin goes deep into the pores and unclog them. This action cleanses pores by removing dead skin cells and other impurities within pores allowing them to appear smaller.
                    
                    Prevents whiteheads and blackheads: Deep cleansing action of the serum for acne prone skin helps exfoliate skin and its oil solubility lets it exfoliate inside the pore to alleviate breakouts, congestion, and blackheads.
                    
                    For best results, use for 2 months.</p>
